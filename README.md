    <h3>08/03/2019</h3>
    <p>Today I learned how to set up a github respository and to publish to Github Pages.</p>
    <p>A special thanks to Becca Williams (@Becca9941) for her tutorial!</p>

    <h3>08/04/2019</h3>
    <p>I completed the 
@traversymedia
 tutorial and created a full-screen landing page using HTML & CSS. I'm reviewing CSS using Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp.</p>
</div>
    <div>
 <h3>08/05/2019</h3>
    <p>I didn't get too much done today. I'm still reviewing CSS basics. Today I reviewed selectors: element, class, and id. Also reviewed colors: hexadecimal, RGB and RBGA. Tomorrow: Specificity.</p>
</div> 
   <div>
    <h3>08/06/2019</h3>
    <p> Continued reviewing CSS and today's focus was inheritance and specificity.  I thought I had specificity in the bag but will need more practice.  No biggie! I've got nothing but time! I WILL master this!</p>

    <div>
  <h3>08/07/2019</h3>
    <p>Today I watched a tutorial by Programming Liftoff to REALLY set up my GitHub Pages and using a Jekyll theme.</p>
  <p>I still have ALOT of work to do but at least I've started something!</p>
</div>
     <div>
  <h3>08/08/2019</h3>
    <p>I FINALLY completed the specificity exercise on the Colt Steele Web Dev Bootcamp. I didn't know I could use 2 nth-of-type selectors side by side!!</p>
  <p>I had a great meeting with my accountability partner, Sonja. We both agree that we need and will ramp up our learning. We're so pumped for the future!</p>

     <h3>08/10/2019</h3>
    <p>Reviewed Box Model: content, padding, border, margin. Completed Tic Tac Toe exercise using HTML <table> element and CSS border properties. Discovered @realtoughcandy & enjoyed reading self-taught dev success stories.</p>
