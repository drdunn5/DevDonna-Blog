    <h3>08/04/2019</h3>
    <p>I completed the 
@traversymedia
 tutorial and created a full-screen landing page using HTML & CSS. I'm reviewing CSS using Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp.</p>

 <h3>08/05/2019</h3>
    <p>I didn't get too much done today. I'm still reviewing CSS basics. Today I reviewed selectors: element, class, and id. Also reviewed colors: hexadecimal, RGB and RBGA. Tomorrow: Specificity.</p>
</div> 
   <div>
    <h3>08/06/2019</h3>
    <p> Continued reviewing CSS and today's focus was inheritance and specificity.  I thought I had specificity in the bag but will need more practice.  No biggie! I've got nothing but time! I WILL master this!</p>

  <h3>08/07/2019</h3>
    <p>Today I watched a tutorial by Programming Liftoff to REALLY set up my GitHub Pages and using a Jekyll theme.</p>
  <p>I still have ALOT of work to do but at least I've started something!</p>
